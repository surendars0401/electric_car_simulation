This Python script simulates the behavior of an electric car, allowing users to control acceleration, braking, and sudden braking. The simulation includes a visual representation of battery status, acceleration, and speed.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of an electric car
- Visual representation of battery status and acceleration
- Adjustable parameters for battery capacity, maximum speed, and control rates
